My doctor has been having me do things to excersize my brain as well as my heart.
So I have doing a bunch of reading - but I find it harder to concentrate, and for 
longer periods of time, and my Memory is nowhere close to what it used to be.

So I have decided to blog about what I am learning so that I can go back and find it. 
It will be publicly available on my page at marchon.Github.io

If you end up reading this, I hope that you enjoy it and find some intersting things.
